# Flutter Program to Get user location in Google map
First update your API key in android manifest file and AppDelegate.swift to access google maps.

 <br /> User location is recieved once the floating action button is pressed. 
 <br /> Once the floating action button is presssed if gps permission is disabled then the app asks for the permission.
 <br /> To avoid null safety issues I have downgraded the sdk version to 2.11.0.
